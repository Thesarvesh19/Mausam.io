A beautiful, bilingual weather dashboard for Indian cities with a personalized touch.

About The Project
Mausam is more than just a weather application; it's a visually rich and culturally relevant experience designed specifically for cities across India. Moving beyond simple data, this app provides a unique "feel" for each location through stunning, city-specific background images and detailed descriptions.

Built with pure Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and the OpenWeatherMap API, Mausam is designed to be lightweight, fast, and aesthetically pleasing. Its standout feature is the seamless bilingual interface, allowing users to instantly switch all content between English and Hindi, making it accessible to a wider audience.

Key Features ‚ú®
Bilingual Interface (English/Hindi): A core feature of the app. A dedicated toggle switches the entire UI, including static text, dates, times, and city descriptions, between English and Hindi.

City-Specific Backgrounds: The app features a curated collection of 30+ high-quality background images for major Indian cities. Searching for a city like "Jaipur" or "Kochi" will set a beautiful, relevant image as the backdrop.

Unique City Descriptions: For the 30+ curated cities, the app displays a multi-line description detailing the city's location, significance, and famous attributes, available in both English and Hindi.

Dynamic Weather Data: Get real-time weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, air pressure, and the day's high/low temperatures.

Smart Image System:

A unique, dedicated background image for the initial home screen.

A rotating set of 4 different default images for any city searched that is not on the curated list.

Dark & Light Mode: A sleek theme toggle allows users to switch between a beautiful dark mode and a clean light mode for comfortable viewing in any lighting condition.

Geolocation Support: On page load, the app can automatically detect the user's location to provide an instant, local weather forecast.

Search with Autocomplete: The search bar provides suggestions from the curated list of 30+ cities as you type, making searches faster and easier.

Persistent User Preferences: The app remembers your choices for language and theme using localStorage, so your experience is saved for your next visit.

Professional UI/UX: Designed with a clean, modern aesthetic, smooth animations, and a professional font stack that correctly renders both English (Montserrat) and Devanagari (Noto Sans Devanagari) scripts without issues.
